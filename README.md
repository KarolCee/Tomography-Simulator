* Given an image creates a sinogram with the Radon transform and then using the backprojection algorithm reconstructs the original image from the sinogram.
* By using interactive widgets we can change features like the angular spread of the emitter-detector configuration or make a  GIF to show the process of creating the sinogram/reconstructing the image.
* The reconstructed image can be saved in the DICOM format.
